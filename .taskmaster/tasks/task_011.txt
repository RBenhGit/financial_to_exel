# Task ID: 11
# Title: Discounted Dividend Model (DDM)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive Discounted Dividend Model with multiple variants (Gordon Growth, Two-stage, Multi-stage) for dividend-focused valuation analysis.
# Details:
1. Implement multiple DDM variants: Gordon Growth Model (single-stage), Two-stage DDM, and Multi-stage DDM for different company profiles. 2. Create dividend data processor to extract and analyze historical dividend payments from financial data sources. 3. Build growth rate estimation engine using historical dividend patterns, earnings growth, and payout ratios. 4. Add model selection logic to automatically choose appropriate DDM variant based on company characteristics (dividend history, growth stage, payout consistency). 5. Integrate DDM with existing valuation framework and watch list system. 6. Create DDM-specific visualizations showing dividend growth trends and valuation sensitivity. 7. Add validation for dividend sustainability using financial health metrics.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test all DDM variants with dividend-paying stocks across different sectors. 2. Verify dividend data extraction and processing accuracy. 3. Test growth rate estimation with various dividend patterns. 4. Validate automatic model selection logic for different company types. 5. Test integration with existing DCF and P/B analysis systems. 6. Verify DDM calculations against manual calculations and industry benchmarks.
