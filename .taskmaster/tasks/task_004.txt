# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Detailed Yahoo Finance API Request Logging and Step-by-Step Monitoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive runtime logging to track each step of Yahoo Finance API requests, capturing intermediate values, response data, and processing steps for debugging and monitoring purposes.
# Details:
1. Create a detailed logging module that captures each step of the yfinance API request process: initial ticker validation, API call preparation, request headers and parameters, response status codes, raw response data, and parsed financial data. 2. Implement step-by-step value printing to runtime log showing: input ticker symbol, constructed API URL, request timestamp, response time, data extraction results (revenue, cash flow, balance sheet items), and any transformation steps. 3. Add structured logging with different verbosity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to allow users to control detail level. 4. Create formatted output that displays intermediate calculations, data validation results, and final processed values in human-readable format. 5. Implement request/response caching with logging to track cache hits/misses and data freshness. 6. Add performance metrics logging including API response times, data processing duration, and memory usage during operations. 7. Create log rotation and management to prevent log files from growing too large during extended usage.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test logging output with various ticker symbols to verify all steps are captured correctly. 2. Verify log formatting is readable and contains all required intermediate values. 3. Test different logging verbosity levels to ensure appropriate detail is shown. 4. Validate that sensitive information (API keys, personal data) is not logged inappropriately. 5. Test log rotation functionality with high-volume API usage scenarios. 6. Verify logging works correctly during error conditions and API failures. 7. Test performance impact of logging to ensure it doesn't significantly slow down API operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Logging Infrastructure and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational logging module with configurable verbosity levels, log formatting, and file management capabilities for Yahoo Finance API monitoring.
### Details:
1. Create a dedicated logging module (yfinance_logger.py) with structured logging using Python's logging library. 2. Implement configurable verbosity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) with appropriate filtering. 3. Set up log formatting for human-readable output with timestamps, log levels, and structured data. 4. Create log file configuration with rotation policies to prevent excessive file growth. 5. Add logging configuration options through config.py or environment variables.

## 2. Implement Request Lifecycle Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add comprehensive logging for each step of the Yahoo Finance API request process, from ticker validation through response processing.
### Details:
1. Log initial ticker symbol validation and format checking. 2. Capture API URL construction and request parameters preparation. 3. Log request headers, timestamps, and authentication details (if any). 4. Record HTTP response status codes, response times, and response size. 5. Log raw response data structure and content validation. 6. Track data parsing and extraction steps for financial metrics.

## 3. Add Data Processing and Transformation Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement detailed logging for data extraction, validation, and transformation steps to track how raw API responses become processed financial data.
### Details:
1. Log extraction of specific financial metrics (revenue, cash flow, balance sheet items) from API responses. 2. Track data validation steps and any data quality issues detected. 3. Log data transformation operations including unit conversions and calculations. 4. Record intermediate calculation values and final processed results. 5. Add logging for data sanitization and error correction steps. 6. Log data structure changes and formatting operations.

## 4. Implement Performance Metrics and Caching Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add comprehensive performance monitoring and caching system logging to track API efficiency, response times, and data freshness.
### Details:
1. Implement performance metrics collection for API response times, data processing duration, and memory usage. 2. Add request/response caching system with cache hit/miss logging. 3. Log cache data freshness and expiration timestamps. 4. Track API rate limiting events and throttling delays. 5. Monitor memory usage during large data processing operations. 6. Add performance benchmarking logs for optimization identification.

## 5. Create Integration Points and User-Friendly Output [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Integrate the logging system with existing modules and create user-friendly log output formats for debugging and monitoring purposes.
### Details:
1. Integrate logging calls into existing Yahoo Finance API wrapper functions in data_processing.py and financial_calculations.py. 2. Create formatted log output displays for console and file output with clear section headers. 3. Add log filtering and search capabilities for specific ticker symbols or time ranges. 4. Implement log summary reports showing API usage statistics and performance metrics. 5. Create debugging modes with enhanced verbosity for troubleshooting. 6. Add configuration options for users to control logging detail level.
