# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Detailed Yahoo Finance API Request Logging and Step-by-Step Monitoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive runtime logging to track each step of Yahoo Finance API requests, capturing intermediate values, response data, and processing steps for debugging and monitoring purposes.
# Details:
1. Create a detailed logging module that captures each step of the yfinance API request process: initial ticker validation, API call preparation, request headers and parameters, response status codes, raw response data, and parsed financial data. 2. Implement step-by-step value printing to runtime log showing: input ticker symbol, constructed API URL, request timestamp, response time, data extraction results (revenue, cash flow, balance sheet items), and any transformation steps. 3. Add structured logging with different verbosity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to allow users to control detail level. 4. Create formatted output that displays intermediate calculations, data validation results, and final processed values in human-readable format. 5. Implement request/response caching with logging to track cache hits/misses and data freshness. 6. Add performance metrics logging including API response times, data processing duration, and memory usage during operations. 7. Create log rotation and management to prevent log files from growing too large during extended usage.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test logging output with various ticker symbols to verify all steps are captured correctly. 2. Verify log formatting is readable and contains all required intermediate values. 3. Test different logging verbosity levels to ensure appropriate detail is shown. 4. Validate that sensitive information (API keys, personal data) is not logged inappropriately. 5. Test log rotation functionality with high-volume API usage scenarios. 6. Verify logging works correctly during error conditions and API failures. 7. Test performance impact of logging to ensure it doesn't significantly slow down API operations.
