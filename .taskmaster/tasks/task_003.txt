# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Input Validation and Pre-flight Checks for Yahoo Finance API Calls
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive validation system to verify ticker symbols, network connectivity, and dependencies before making yfinance API calls to prevent unnecessary requests and improve error handling.
# Details:
1. Create input validation module with ticker symbol format validation (length limits, character restrictions, exchange suffixes). 2. Implement network connectivity checker using lightweight HTTP requests to verify internet connection before API calls. 3. Add dependency verification to ensure yfinance library and required modules are properly installed and accessible. 4. Create pre-flight validation pipeline that runs all checks before any API request: validate ticker format, check network status, verify library availability. 5. Add validation result caching to avoid repeated checks for the same session. 6. Implement detailed error messages for each validation failure type with suggested remediation steps. 7. Add configuration options for validation strictness levels (strict, moderate, permissive). 8. Create validation logging to track which checks pass/fail for debugging purposes. 9. Integrate validation pipeline into existing data fetching workflow in centralized_data_manager.py and related modules. 10. Add timeout handling for network connectivity checks to prevent hanging operations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test ticker symbol validation with various formats: valid symbols (AAPL, MSFT), invalid characters (AP@PL), empty strings, None values, and edge cases like symbols with exchange suffixes (.TO, .L). 2. Test network connectivity validation by simulating offline conditions and verifying appropriate error handling. 3. Test dependency verification by temporarily removing yfinance library and ensuring graceful failure detection. 4. Create integration tests that verify the complete validation pipeline prevents API calls when any check fails. 5. Test validation caching by running multiple requests with same parameters and verifying cache hits. 6. Verify error message clarity and actionability for each validation failure scenario. 7. Test performance impact of validation overhead on overall data fetching speed. 8. Test validation under various network conditions: slow connections, intermittent connectivity, and DNS resolution issues.
