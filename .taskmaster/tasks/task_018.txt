# Task ID: 18
# Title: NumPy Best Practices Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement proper NumPy floating-point error handling, deprecation warning management, and type-safe array operations
# Details:
1. Implement np.errstate() context managers for controlled floating-point error handling in financial calculations. 2. Add proper NumPy deprecation warning management and ensure compatibility with NumPy 2.x. 3. Use type-safe array creation patterns and avoid deprecated NumPy APIs. 4. Implement proper handling of NaN, inf values in financial calculations with np.isfinite() checks. 5. Add NumPy error configuration for division by zero, overflow, and invalid operations. 6. Ensure proper memory management and array view handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test floating-point error handling with edge cases like division by zero. Verify deprecation warnings are properly managed. Test type safety with various array operations. Validate NaN/inf handling in financial calculations.
