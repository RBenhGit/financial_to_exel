# Task ID: 8
# Title: Alternative Financial Data Inputs
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement API connections for financial data sources including Alpha Vantage, Financial Modeling Prep, and Polygon.io as alternatives to Excel file inputs. Create unified data adapter pattern with fallback hierarchy and rate limiting.
# Details:
1. Create unified data adapter pattern to support multiple data sources (Excel files, Alpha Vantage API, Financial Modeling Prep API, Polygon.io API). 2. Implement API connectors for major financial data providers with standardized interfaces. 3. Add configuration system for API credentials, preferences, and source priority. 4. Create fallback hierarchy (Primary API → Secondary API → Excel files) with automatic switching. 5. Implement rate limiting and caching strategies for API usage optimization. 6. Add data quality validation and standardization layer to normalize formats across sources. 7. Create cost management features for paid APIs with usage tracking and limits.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test data adapter pattern with multiple sources and validate consistent output formats. 2. Test API connectors with real API calls and mock responses for reliability. 3. Verify fallback system activates correctly when primary sources fail. 4. Test rate limiting and caching with high-volume requests. 5. Validate data quality and accuracy across different sources. 6. Test cost management features with API usage tracking.
