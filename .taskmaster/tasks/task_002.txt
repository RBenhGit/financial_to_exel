# Title: Debug Yahoo Finance API Rate Limiting and Implement Robust Data Fetching
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve HTTP 429 rate limiting errors in Yahoo Finance API calls and implement comprehensive retry logic with fallback data sources for reliable market data retrieval in DCF calculations.
# Details:
1. Analyze fetch_issue.txt log file to identify specific failure patterns at lines 99-100 and 129-130. 2. Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism with configurable delays (start at 1s, max 60s). 3. Add request rate limiting with token bucket or sliding window algorithm to prevent exceeding API limits. 4. Create fallback data source integration (Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or Polygon.io) with automatic switching when Yahoo Finance fails. 5. Add comprehensive error handling and logging to track API health and usage patterns. 6. Implement data caching mechanism to reduce API calls for recently fetched data. 7. Add configuration options for API timeout settings, retry attempts, and rate limits. 8. Create data validation layer to ensure fetched financial data integrity before DCF calculations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for rate limiting logic with mock API responses returning 429 errors. 2. Test exponential backoff behavior with simulated network delays and API failures. 3. Verify fallback data source activation when primary API is unavailable. 4. Test data caching functionality with various cache expiration scenarios. 5. Run integration tests with actual Yahoo Finance API to ensure rate limits are respected. 6. Validate that DCF calculations continue working seamlessly with new data fetching layer. 7. Monitor API usage patterns in test environment to confirm rate limiting effectiveness. 8. Test error recovery scenarios including network timeouts and malformed responses.
