# Task ID: 23
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Apply modern pandas/numpy performance patterns and optimize DataFrame operations for large datasets
# Details:
1. Apply pandas performance best practices including vectorized operations and avoiding apply() where possible. 2. Optimize memory usage with appropriate dtype selections and memory-efficient data structures. 3. Implement intelligent caching for expensive financial calculations and API responses. 4. Use pandas query() method for efficient DataFrame filtering. 5. Optimize Excel reading operations with specific columns and dtype specifications. 6. Add progress indicators for long-running operations in Streamlit interface.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance improvements with large datasets. Test memory usage with multiple company analysis. Verify caching improves repeated calculations. Validate optimizations don't affect calculation accuracy.
