# Task ID: 25
# Title: Fix PB Valuation Calculation Errors
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Debug and fix errors occurring in the Price-to-Book (P/B) valuation module when attempting to calculate valuations
# Details:
The PB valuation module is experiencing errors during calculations. Key issues to address: 1. Market data fetching failures across multiple data sources (enhanced data manager, yfinance). 2. Book value calculation problems with shareholders' equity extraction from balance sheet data. 3. Shares outstanding detection issues. 4. Enhanced data manager integration problems with API response parsing. 5. Insufficient error handling and unclear error messages. 6. Data format inconsistencies between different data sources. Need to implement robust error handling, improve data extraction logic, add retry mechanisms, and provide better user feedback.

# Test Strategy:
Test P/B calculations with various ticker symbols including edge cases. Verify error handling provides clear messages. Test fallback mechanisms between data sources. Validate calculation accuracy against known values.
