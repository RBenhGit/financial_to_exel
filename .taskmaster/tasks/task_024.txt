# Task ID: 24
# Title: Code Quality Modernization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Modernize code patterns, organize imports, and apply consistent formatting throughout the codebase
# Details:
1. Update to modern Python patterns including f-strings, pathlib, and dataclasses where appropriate. 2. Standardize import statements and remove unused imports across all modules. 3. Apply consistent code formatting with black and ensure PEP 8 compliance. 4. Replace deprecated Python features with modern alternatives. 5. Organize module structure for better maintainability and clear dependencies. 6. Add pre-commit hooks for automated code quality checks.

# Test Strategy:
Run code quality tools (black, isort, flake8) on all modules. Verify modern Python features work correctly. Test that code formatting is consistent. Validate pre-commit hooks catch quality issues.
