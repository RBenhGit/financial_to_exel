# Task ID: 21
# Title: Testing Enhancement & Edge Cases
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive edge case testing for negative cash flows, missing data, and API failures
# Details:
1. Add tests for negative free cash flow scenarios and companies with financial distress. 2. Create comprehensive tests for missing financial data and incomplete API responses. 3. Add performance benchmarks for large datasets and multiple company analysis. 4. Implement property-based testing for financial calculations with hypothesis library. 5. Add integration tests for complete workflows from data fetching to DCF analysis. 6. Create stress tests for API rate limiting and network failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test with real-world edge cases like companies with negative FCF. Verify system handles incomplete financial data gracefully. Test performance with datasets of 100+ companies. Validate property-based tests catch calculation errors.
