# Task ID: 6
# Title: Enhance DCF CSV Export with Analysis Metadata
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Expand the CSV export functionality in the DCF tab to include comprehensive analysis metadata: date of analysis, assumptions used, company ticker symbol, calculated enterprise value, fair value, and current market price. Structure the output for database import compatibility.
# Details:
1. Modify the CSV export function in the DCF tab to include additional metadata columns: analysis_date (timestamp), assumptions (text field with key parameters like growth rates, discount rates, terminal value assumptions), ticker_symbol (company identifier), calculated_enterprise_value (EV result), calculated_fair_value (per share fair value), current_market_price (real-time stock price for comparison). 2. Restructure the CSV format for database compatibility with proper column headers, data types, and normalization. Consider creating separate tables/sections for: company_info (ticker, name), analysis_parameters (assumptions, rates, methodology), results (EV, fair value, market price, analysis date), and raw_data (financial statements used). 3. Add data validation to ensure all required fields are populated before export. 4. Implement proper handling of missing or invalid data with appropriate defaults or error messages. 5. Add export configuration options allowing users to select which metadata fields to include. 6. Ensure the CSV structure follows database best practices with primary keys, proper data types, and referential integrity considerations. 7. Integrate market price fetching using existing yfinance infrastructure to get current stock price at analysis time.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test CSV export with various companies to ensure all metadata fields including market price are properly populated and formatted. 2. Verify the CSV structure is compatible with database import tools by testing imports into SQLite, PostgreSQL, or similar databases. 3. Test edge cases like missing financial data, invalid ticker symbols, incomplete DCF calculations, and market price fetch failures to ensure graceful error handling. 4. Validate that exported data maintains accuracy and precision for financial values and market prices. 5. Test export functionality with different analysis assumptions and verify they are correctly captured in the metadata. 6. Verify market price data is fetched at analysis time and matches expected values. 7. Perform roundtrip testing by exporting data and reimporting to verify data integrity including price comparisons.
