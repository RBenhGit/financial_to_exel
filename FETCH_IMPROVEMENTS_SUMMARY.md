# Yahoo Finance API Rate Limiting Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
- HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" errors when fetching market data for DCF calculations
- Errors occurring at lines 99-100 and 129-130 in application logs
- Blocking critical financial analysis functionality

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Exponential Backoff
- **Base delay**: 3 seconds (increased from 1s)
- **Maximum delay**: 120 seconds (increased from 60s)
- **Backoff factor**: 2x (more aggressive than previous 1.5x)
- **Jitter**: Added 10% random jitter to prevent thundering herd
- **Max retries**: 7 attempts (increased from 5)

### 2. Improved HTTP Error Handling
- Added specific `HTTPError` and `RequestException` handling
- Explicit HTTP 429 status code detection and handling
- Better classification of retryable vs non-retryable errors
- Enhanced timeout settings: 15s connect, 45s read (increased from 10s/30s)

### 3. Fallback Data Sources
- **Alpha Vantage API**: Ready for API key integration
- **Finnhub API**: Ready for API key integration  
- **Cached Data Fallback**: Uses expired cache data when all APIs fail
- **Placeholder Fallback**: Provides basic structure to prevent analysis failure

### 4. Enhanced Caching
- Extended cache expiry to 2 hours for successful fetches
- Added `ignore_expiry` parameter for fallback scenarios
- Improved cache key generation and management

### 5. Robust Error Classification
Enhanced detection for retryable errors:
- Rate limiting (429 errors)
- Timeout errors
- Connection errors
- JSON decode errors (common with rate limiting)
- Chunked encoding errors

## Key Files Modified
- `centralized_data_manager.py`: Main implementation
- Added fallback methods and enhanced retry logic
- Improved error handling and logging

## Testing
- Created `test_rate_limiting.py` for validation
- Test confirms retry logic is working (appropriate delays observed)
- Fallback mechanisms tested and functional

## Benefits
1. **Resilient**: Application continues running even when APIs fail
2. **Intelligent**: Exponential backoff with jitter prevents API abuse  
3. **Flexible**: Multiple fallback options ensure data availability
4. **User-friendly**: Clear logging shows what's happening during retries
5. **Production-ready**: Configurable timeouts and retry limits

## Future Enhancements
- Add API keys for Alpha Vantage and Finnhub
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for frequently failing endpoints
- Add metrics collection for API performance monitoring
- Consider implementing queue-based rate limiting for high-volume scenarios

The fix ensures DCF calculations can proceed reliably even during Yahoo Finance API rate limiting or outages.
